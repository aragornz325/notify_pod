# Notification Pod for Serverpod

This repository contains a highly customizable and agnostic notification system for Serverpod. The purpose of this pod is to provide a unified way to handle notifications across multiple services and channels, such as emails, SMS, and push notifications.

## What We Do

The Notification Pod acts as a middleware for managing notifications in your Serverpod-based projects. It decouples the logic for sending notifications from your application code, making it easier to switch providers or add new channels as needed.

## How It Works

1. **Modular Design**: The pod is built to support multiple notification channels. Each channel is implemented as a separate module that can be easily plugged in or replaced.
2. **Provider Integration**: The pod comes with built-in support for popular notification services, and you can extend it by implementing your own provider interfaces.
3. **Flexible Configuration**: All configuration, such as API keys and channel preferences, can be managed via a centralized settings file or environment variables.
4. **Queue System**: Notifications can be queued to ensure reliability and scalability in high-load environments.

## Purpose

The Notification Pod is ideal for projects that require:
- Multi-channel notification support (email, SMS, push notifications, etc.).
- Centralized notification management.
- Scalable and reliable delivery of messages.
- Easy integration and maintenance of notification logic.

## How to Integrate

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/notification-pod-serverpod.git
   cd notification-pod-serverpod
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   serverpod generate
   dart pub get
   ```

3. Add the pod to your Serverpod configuration by updating the `config.yaml` file to include this pod.

4. Implement your desired notification channels by following the provided templates and documentation in the `channels/` directory.

5. Call the notification service from your Serverpod endpoints:
   ```dart
   var notificationService = NotificationService();
   await notificationService.send(
       Notification(
           channel: 'email',
           recipient: 'user@example.com',
           message: 'Hello, this is a test notification!',
       ),
   );
   ```

## Future Plans

We plan to:
- Add more built-in providers for popular services.
- Support advanced features like templates and analytics tracking.
- Enhance documentation with examples for common use cases.
